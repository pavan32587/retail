  
## Overview

`smart-aircon` is a small python program whose main job is to predict air conditioner controlling actions from user. The prediction is based on user context information collected through sensor system.

In order to fulfil such a job, it firstly needs to build a prediction model from previously observed data, and certainly before that, it also needs to perform data pre-processing. So, basically `smart-aircon.py` will do these following tasks:

+ Processing raw data. Sensor data in raw format can be processed for constructing the prediction model.
+ Training model from processed data; the model are later used for generating prediction.
+ Making prediction given a sensor data input with the trained model.
+ Evaluating prediction performance (k-fold cross validation) of the model for analysis purpose.
+ Reinforcing model; using user's feedback data to improve model prediction performance (more research needs).

### Download and installation
The program source code can be downloaded from [this github repository](https://github.com/reogac/smart-home.git).

You will need [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) to clone the repository

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/reogac/smart-home.git
```
Several python packages are requred for running the program, including [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) (for classification model learning), [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) (for python objsect serialization) ~~and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (for data frame processing).~~ (data processing has been re-writen, pandas is no longer required)

### Demo
If you are not familiar with python package installation, perhaps it is a better idea to try the program on a ready-to-run computer. I have installed the program as well as neccesary packages on a Beaglebone black (BBB) machine. The machine can be accessed using ssh (debian/temppwd):

```bash
    ssh debian@reogac.iptime.org -p 2222
```

Once you are at the terminal console of the BBB, go the folder that has the program:

```bash
    cd ~/smart-home
```

From there, following below instructions to run the program.

## <a id="training-model"/>Training model


Before prediction can be made, a model must be trained from observed data. Usually the training should be performed on a computer with high computation power. However, some algorithms such as decision tree, random forest, can perform comfortably on lightweight machines such as Beaglebone black, as long as the data size is reasonable small.

The input for training model can be raw data in csv format or processed data which was the output of [data processing step](#data-processing).

For input is raw data, the command should be:
```bash
    smart-aircon train -t raw-data-file -m model-file -c classification-method
```

For input is processed data, the command should be:
```bash
    smart-aircon train -d processed-data-file -m model-file -c classification-method
```

Here, the classification method can either be `tree` for Desison tree or `forest` for Random forest. Default value for the parameter is `tree`.

If the training succeed, it should save the model into the specified `model-file`.

Training should be performed periodically. It can be done easily on any linux system by using a time-based scheduler such as [crontab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).

### Note
Currently model trained on 64 bit computer can not be loaded on BBB (32 bit machine). The reason is that `scikit-learn` package uses different data types on the two architectures. A work around solution is to install a 32bit linux OS for training the model.


## <a id="data-processing"/>Data pre-processing

Training model consists of two consecutive steps: pre-processing raw data and learning model (from the processed data). Both steps are computational extensive on lightweight machine, thus it is advisible to perform one or both of them on more powerful computer then copy the output to the target machine. While different classification algorithms may require diffrent levels of computational power, the requirment for data pre-processing stays the same, mostly depending on the size of the data. Breaking down the training into two therefore makes deployment more flexible.

Pre-processing raw data can be perform with this following command:

``` bash
    smart-aircon process -t raw--data-file -d processed-data-file
```
Here `raw-data-file` is the sensor data collected in a csv format and `processed-data-file` is the output file. The processed data then can be used as input for [model training](#training-model)


## Making a prediction

Once the model is trained, the program can make prediction of user action based on input data from sensor system. Inputs should be all sensor information measured at the time of predition. To make a prediction, the following command should be called:

```bash
    smart-aircon predict -m model-file -s sensor-data
```
where `model-file` is the previously trained model and the `sensor-data` should conform to the format examplified like this:
```bash
"power=0, temp=37, humidity=50, dust=100, CO2=1000, light=30, day=2,hour=19.5"
```

The command return the predicted action of user which can be one of three possible outcomes: `TURN-ON`, `TURN-OFF` or `DO-NOTHING`.

### When to make prediction?

Let suppose that we have a module called `Action Recommender` that interacts with user and recommend him which action he should take then act accordingly to the his decision (turn on/off the air conditioner). Basically, the module should interface with three other modules:

 + interacts with user mobile application (it can be `restful` or any kind of message-based interface)
 + interacts with prediction module (this program, aka `smart-aircon`; interface is command line)
 + interacts with controller module (to control air conditioner)
 
The module should not wait for user to initiate a prediction request, instead it has to make prediction pediodically. In order to do so, it should read sensor data, for example, in every 3 minutes, then call the prediction command to get the predicted user action. Depending on the prediction outcome, it can choose either to ignore (do nothing) or recommend user to take a action (turn on or turn off).

Therefore, the `Action Recommender` should be implemented as a daemon or it can be a bash or python script associated with a crontab job that runs periodically (3 minutes).

## Model reinforcemence

Model reinforcement is the process of re-training the model upon receiving user's feedback, with expectation of improving prediction quality. As the user feedback data is not available at the moment, this feature has not been implemented. Further research will need to find a appropriate reinformance learning method for the problem.
